SQL Code:

**Solution 1**

```sql
# Write your MySQL query statement below

SELECT *
FROM (
    SELECT visited_on,
    SUM(daily_amount) OVER(ORDER BY visited_on ROWS 6 PRECEDING) AS amount,
    ROUND(AVG(daily_amount) OVER(ORDER BY visited_on ROWS 6 PRECEDING), 2) AS average_amount
    FROM (
        SELECT visited_on, SUM(amount) AS daily_amount
        FROM Customer
        GROUP BY visited_on
        ORDER BY visited_on
    ) AS temp1
) AS temp2
WHERE DATEDIFF(visited_on, (SELECT MIN(visited_on) FROM Customer)) >= 6
```
**NOTE:**
- ROWS PRECEDING / FOLLOWING的使用可以达到Rolling Window的功能
