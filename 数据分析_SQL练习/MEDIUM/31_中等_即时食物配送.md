**Solution 1**

```sql
# Write your MySQL query statement below

SELECT ROUND(SUM(immediate) / COUNT(immediate) * 100, 2) AS immediate_percentage
FROM (
    SELECT *, MIN(order_date) OVER(PARTITION BY  customer_id) AS first_date,
    CASE WHEN order_date = customer_pref_delivery_date THEN 1 ELSE 0 END AS immediate
    FROM Delivery
) AS temp
WHERE order_date = first_date
```
**Solution 2**
```SQL
# Write your MySQL query statement below

SELECT ROUND(SUM(immediate) / COUNT(immediate) * 100, 2) AS immediate_percentage
FROM (
    SELECT *, RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY  customer_id ORDER BY order_date) AS order_rnk,
    CASE WHEN order_date = customer_pref_delivery_date THEN 1 ELSE 0 END AS immediate
    FROM Delivery
) AS temp
WHERE order_rnk = 1

```

**NOTE:**
- SOL1用了MIN()在窗口函数的用法
