SQL Code:

**Solution 1**

```sql
# Write your MySQL query statement below
SELECT DISTINCT e.student_id, student_name
FROM Exam e LEFT JOIN Student s
ON e.student_id = s.student_id
WHERE e.student_id NOT IN (
        (SELECT student_id
    FROM (
        SELECT student_id, RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY exam_id ORDER BY score DESC) AS rnk
        FROM Exam
    ) AS temp1
    WHERE rnk = 1
    )

    UNION ALL

    (SELECT student_id
    FROM (
        SELECT student_id, RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY exam_id ORDER BY score) AS rnk
        FROM Exam
    ) AS temp2
    WHERE rnk = 1
    ))
ORDER BY e.student_id

```

**Note；**
- 思路：找到排名第一和最后的学生，然后NOT IN
