SQL Code:

**Solution 1**

```sql
# Write your MySQL query statement below
SELECT item_category AS category,
SUM(CASE WHEN WEEKDAY(order_date) = 0 THEN quantity ELSE 0 END) AS Monday,
SUM(CASE WHEN WEEKDAY(order_date) = 1 THEN quantity ELSE 0 END) AS Tuesday,
SUM(CASE WHEN WEEKDAY(order_date) = 2 THEN quantity ELSE 0 END) AS Wednesday,
SUM(CASE WHEN WEEKDAY(order_date) = 3 THEN quantity ELSE 0 END) AS Thursday,
SUM(CASE WHEN WEEKDAY(order_date) = 4 THEN quantity ELSE 0 END) AS Friday,
SUM(CASE WHEN WEEKDAY(order_date) = 5 THEN quantity ELSE 0 END) AS Saturday,
SUM(CASE WHEN WEEKDAY(order_date) = 6 THEN quantity ELSE 0 END) AS Sunday

FROM Orders o RIGHT JOIN Items i
ON o.item_id = i.item_id

GROUP BY item_category
ORDER BY category

```

**Note；**
- WEEKDAY() 可以直接返回日期是周几
- 因为存在有的category没有订单的情况，所以要用right join
