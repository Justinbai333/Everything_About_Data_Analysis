SQL Code:

**Solution 1**

```sql
# Write your MySQL query statement below
SELECT team_id, team_name, SUM(score) AS num_points
FROM (
    SELECT team_id, team_name, IFNULL(SUM(host_score), 0) AS Score
    FROM Teams t1 LEFT JOIN (
        SELECT *,
        CASE WHEN host_goals > guest_goals THEN 3 WHEN host_goals = guest_goals THEN 1 ELSE 0 END AS host_score,
        CASE WHEN host_goals < guest_goals THEN 3 WHEN host_goals = guest_goals THEN 1 ELSE 0 END AS guest_score
        FROM Matches
    ) AS t2
    ON t1.team_id = t2.host_team
    GROUP BY team_id

    UNION ALL

    SELECT team_id, team_name, IFNULL(SUM(guest_score), 0) AS Score
    FROM Teams t1 LEFT JOIN (
        SELECT *,
        CASE WHEN host_goals > guest_goals THEN 3 WHEN host_goals = guest_goals THEN 1 ELSE 0 END AS host_score,
        CASE WHEN host_goals > guest_goals THEN 0 WHEN host_goals = guest_goals THEN 1 ELSE 3 END AS guest_score
        FROM Matches
    ) AS t2
    ON t1.team_id = t2.guest_team
    GROUP BY team_id
) AS temp
GROUP BY team_id
ORDER BY num_points DESC, team_id
```
